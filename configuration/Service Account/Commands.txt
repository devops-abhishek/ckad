Create Service Account :
#kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard-sa
When we create Service Account automatically a token is created using secret object.

Every Namespace is having a default service account and secret created by default which is mounted on every pod object within the namespace
If I want to modify that, then i need to update the pod yaml.
Path : /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
            ca.crt
            namespace
            token
